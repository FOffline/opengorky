//! The converter: a Classic game into an OpenGorky project,
//! one way. The Classic reader's classes (the runtime's, with their `.var`) and the rules
//! in force are the model; each object becomes a data block of its location in archive
//! order (the order the exe makes them in: the logs and the random draws depend on it)
//! and its class one component (`script/classic/ogsify.zig`, its inherited functions
//! too: the class as the exe resolves it). What the creation events set provably as
//! data (`classic/lift.zig`, the runtime's conservative options) leaves the code:
//! - a variable's value → a field of the block (schema fields) or `var T name = v;`
//!   (the class's own variables), only where it differs from what the OG reader starts
//!   the object with (the schema's default, its look);
//! - `act_*.ss` (ActorSetWalkSpeed, RegisterIdleAnimation, RegisterAnimation of init(),
//!   NotInPlaceAnimation, ReferenceAnimation of postinit()) → a shared `look` block
//!   (an animation the model lacks stays, as Classic registers it: the build warns);
//! - initCamera() → `camera = Camera(…)`; the level's restore() PlaceActor → `placement`;
//!   a level's restore() placing unconditionally → its objects' `tile`/`at`, its `placement`
//!   (`liftPlacing`).
//! The rest stays each event's code. Scenes and dialogs are blocks (texts cp1251 →
//! UTF-8), the rules every table's rows (keyed by archetypes where a number is only
//! theirs, `keyRefs`), the texts of `string.tab`, `items.inf` and `activeareas.inf` on
//! the blocks owning their numbers (`name`, `examine`), the rest rows (`UiText`,
//! `Examine`, `AreaExamine`, UTF-8), the heroes `characters::<hero>` and the game's
//! `party`. A location's objects of one Classic entity script (`ft_*.ss`, `wp_*.ss`) are
//! instances of one archetype (`fold`). The OG writer writes it (compose/og/write.zig), the manifest last.
//! The one place that sees both formats (scripts/layercheck.sh).
